jack.play - Announce

jack.play  is a light-weight JACK sound file player. It creates as many
output ports as there are channels in the input file.  It implements no
connection logic, use jack.plumbing(1) instead.

jack.play will read files in any format supported by libsndfile.

A pre-release archive is available at <http://www.alphalink.com.au/~rd>
